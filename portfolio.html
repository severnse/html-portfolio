        Hi, I'm Eli.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm an English major from Las Cruces, New Mexixo at New Mexico State University, concentrated in Rhetoric, Media, and Professional Communications.
        I cook a lot, I bake a lot, I trail off a lot when I start jabbering a lot, but if you're here, you're here to examine my HTML Portfolio, currently underconstruction as I learn more about Web Design and Development. I am excited to see how this site changes as I learn and improve.

        <h2>Practice Page 1, "That Cat Over There!"</h2> <!--I plan on putting the <a> component to navigate in the headers-->
        <p>
            The first website I put together with the tutorials on the Canvas page! It's an odd little website but I thought it was fun to make.

        <h2>Practice Page 2, "Ben Grimm"</h2> <!--Here too-->
        <p>
            The practice page I put together while learning a bit more about CSS, styled on the character of Marvel's The Thing, Ben Grimm.
